# Analyzing-the-Successfulness-of-Crowdfunding-Projects-on-Kickstarter
## Problem:
Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects, a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing creative project to life. Until now, Kickstarter has raised over 4 billion dollars in sponsor of over 150 thousand projects.
Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis i.e if a project doesn’t meet it goal, the project owner gets nothing. For example: if a project's goal is $500. Even if it gets funded till $499, the project won’t be a success.
There is substantial variation in the success rate of projects falling under different categories. Over two thirds of completed dance projects have been successful. In contrast, fewer than 30% of completed fashion projects have reached their goal. Most failing projects fail to achieve 20% of their goals and this trend applies across all categories. Indeed, over 80% of projects that pass the 20% mark reach their goal.
We are interested in which specific characters leads to a successful fundraising for a project.
